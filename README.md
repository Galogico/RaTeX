# RaTeX
RaTeX (totally original name) is a CLI that takes an already existing text file and converts some of it's lines to pre-made text (I used some text-art for testing)
## Hot to use?
First, to run this code, cargo is a requirement.
When oyu download cargo and clone this project you're gonna create a .rl file (it can be any extension, i used .rl just for the sake of cool)
Next, you're gonna write your text inside this file. If you want to use any of the pre made text, break the line and write any command
Finally, you're going to the terminal and write this:
```
cargo run -- //yourfilename//.rl
```
And it will create a output.txt, where you can read your modified text
